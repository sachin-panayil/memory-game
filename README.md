## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

[StackOverFlow was a great resource that helped me with logic and explanation of the three languages]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[One challenge that I encountered was developing the logic to create a random number and to push it into an array. After reading various blog posts and testing different ways, I finally got it to work. I overcame this obstacle by culminating my knowledge that I received through researching the issue. Another issue I had come across was attempting to learn and implement new languages on the fly. I realized the best way to tackle this was to take your time. For each section that would explain a new part of CSS, HTMl, or Javascript, I would first research further into on my own so that I would fully understand the concepts. My final issue was attempting to put a picture isnide the button. I believed that the game would've looked much cleaner if I was succesfull in this task. The ways that I tackled this was deliberate research. I used sites such as Youtube and StackOverFlow in an attempt to figure it out. Although I didn't get to implement it, I still did learn alot about images in general in HTML.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[Some questions I have about web development is does a web developer have to be extremely proficient in all three languages or should one focus on strictly one language and build their skills just for that one language. Another question I have is are these the only three languages that are involved in web development? Does implementing harder things such as a carousel picture view require a different language or can that be done in JavaScript]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[If i had a few more hours on this project, I would definitely implement all the optional featues. The thing that intrigued me the most was the feature that gave the user limited time for each turn. I would go through the same process and attempt to research the two functions that were included. Something else I would've like to work on was a multiplayer function. You can verse someone random and play in a competeion between them. I would have to learn alot about web development in that case as it seems like a intermediate task.]
